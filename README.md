# Deep_Drive_Image_Segmentation

Semantic segmentation has been a challenging computer vision problem since a few years.
This related work includes a semantic segmentation neural network which combines the strengths of 
U-Net and residual learning for image segmentation. The network has a similar architecture to that of U-Net.
In order to get an insight into the whole working procedure kindly find the attached report.
